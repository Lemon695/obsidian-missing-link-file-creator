# Missing Link File Creator

English | [中文](./README.zh-cn.md)

The plugin creates both missing links and the corresponding files.

## Plugin Use Cases

During the process of document editing (such as "novel writing"), an article usually exceeds 3,000 words and contains multiple special terms such as character names, locations, weapons, etc. 

These special terms need to be added to new documents for descriptions. However, during the editing process, the user prefers to stay focused and does not want to click document name links one by one. The user would like to use a plugin command to batch create new documents after the article is fully edited.
