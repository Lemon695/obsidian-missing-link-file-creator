# Plugin Use Cases

During document editing (e.g., "novel writing"), an article often exceeds 3,000 words, and many links, such as `[[Character Profiles]]` or `[[Task List]]`, are created during the writing process. However, these files may not have been created yet. With this plugin, you can quickly generate the corresponding files without manually creating them one by one, improving efficiency.
